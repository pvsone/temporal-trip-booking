# Temporal Trip Booking

## Overview

The Temporal trip booking workflow is responsible for coordinating the booking of a vacation package, consisting of a
flight, hotel, and car reservation. In the event of a failure at any point during the booking process, the workflow
will trigger compensating actions to undo any previous bookings. This is an implementation of a Saga pattern. A Saga
ensures that a business process is atomic, that is, it executes observably equivalent to completely or not at all.

## Running

### Prerequisites
Install the language tools using [asdf](https://asdf-vm.com/guide/getting-started.html)

```bash
# Add the plugins
asdf plugin-add python
asdf plugin-add poetry
asdf plugin-add golang
asdf plugin-add java
asdf plugin-add gradle
asdf plugin-add nodejs

# Install the tools in the .tool-versions file
asdf install
```

Install the [Temporal CLI](https://docs.temporal.io/cli)

### Start the Temporal server
```bash
temporal server start
```

### Run the UI
```bash
cd ui
./start_ui.sh
```

### Run the worker
```bash
cd python
./start_worker.sh
```

## Demo

### Happy Path
Enter your booking information in the Flask app <http://127.0.0.1:5000>, then see the tasks in the Web UI at
<http://localhost:8233/>.

### Durable Path
Use ctrl+c to kill the worker process at any time during workflow execution.  Restart the worker to resume the
function execution in a new process.

### Recover Forward (retries)
Add the word "Flaky" to the Flight input field.  The flight booking activity will fail 5 times, and succeed on the
6th attempt.

### Recover Forward (bug in code)
Add the word "Buggy" to the Hotel input field.  The hotel booking activity will fail indefinitely - until the bug in
the activity function is fixed, and the worker is restarted.

### Recover Backward (rollback)
Add the word "Invalid" to the Car input field.  The car booking activity will fail with and non-retryable error,
and the flight and hotel bookings will be rolled back.
